Hey guys, did you know that in terms of male human and female Pokémon breeding, Vaporeon is the most compatible Pokémon for humans? It has the highest mate-sperm-transfer-rate, which means it is the most common Pokémon for human breeding. However, you shouldn't worry too much about that, since most of the breeding partners are imaginary, so don't bother looking for them.

What really matters is how the species relates to humans. For example, Tangela is not an ideal breeding partner for humans because the Pokémon is too shy. Pokémon that are good for breeding are usually animals that are either children's favorite animals or Pokémon whose DNA has been extracted to form a creature that people think is cute. The Pokémon species does not have to be common and most of the time has to be more rare, or have rare traits.
